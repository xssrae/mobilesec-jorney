With Android Studio it's easy to run the app on your physical phone with developer mode enabled.

To enable the developer settings you have to tap the _Build Number_ several times. After that you can plugin your phone via USB and select "Allow USB debugging".

As long as the app project's SDK version is compatible with your phone's Android version you will now be able to run the app on your phone.

## Sending Intents

Intents and activities are a fundamental concept of Android. We need to understand how they work in order to look for vulnerabilities later. That's why we are going to play around with Intents in our example app.

```java
Intent browserIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse("https://hextree.io/"));
startActivity(browserIntent);
```

The above code example declares our intention (_Intent_) to view (_ACTION_VIEW_) the URL [https://hextree.io/](https://hextree.io/). If we hand over this Intent object to the Android operating system, it will figure out which app can handle this. This means intents can be used to interact with other apps, which makes them one of the most important attack surfaces.

## Receiving Intents

In the previous video we have send an Intent. Now let's learn about the receiving side, how can our app make itself available to other apps?

First of all we have to `export` an activity that they can be started by other applications. By adding `intent-filter` we can also declare that our activity can handle certain intents:

```xml
// AndroidManifest.xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
    <data android:mimeType="text/plain" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
</intent-filter>
```

If another application sent us an intent, we can handle this in our activity code by calling `getIntent()`.

## Decompiling Our Clicker App

Let's quickly see what a potential security analyst would see when decompiling our application using the [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) decompiler. We will dive much deeper into reverse engineering in the [Introduction to Reverse Engineering Android Apps](https://app.hextree.io/courses/reverse-android-apps) course, but seeing how our Java code compares to the decompiled code is a great introduction into the topic.
